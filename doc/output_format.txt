Annotated terminals must be in the folowing format:
<original tag>_<annotated state>
The annotated states must be numbered from 0.
Example:
@NP^g_4

The output grammar must consist of three files with the following suffix.

.grammar:
Grammar rules (binary and unary) and their probabilities.
<parent> -> <left child> <right child> <probability>
Example:
@NP^g_0 -> -LRB-_0 DT_5 2.7901577260037124E-8

.lexicon:
Probabilities of generating each word.
<annotated tag> -> <word> <probability>
Example:
SYM_0 & 0.09090909090909097

.states:
Number of annotated states for each tag.
Must starts from zero and indexed by consecutive integers.
<original tag> <number of states>
Example:
S^g   23 true
