abstract = {Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) have played an important role in the model- ing of syntax in natural language processing and other applications, but choosing the proper model complexity is often difficult. We present a nonparametric Bayesian generalization of the PCFG based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). In our HDP-PCFG model, the effective complexity of the grammar can grow with increasing data. We describe an efficient variational inference algorithm for our model and present experiments on both a synthetic grammar induc- tion task and a large-scale natural language parsing task.

@article{Matsuzaki2005,
abstract = {This paper defines a generative probabilistic model of parse trees, which we call PCFG-LA. This model is an extension of PCFG in which non-terminal symbols are augmented with latent variables. Fine grained CFG rules are automatically induced from a parsed corpus by training a PCFG-LA model using an EM-algorithm. Because exact parsing with a PCFG-LA is NP-hard, several approximations are described and empirically compared. In experiments using the Penn WSJ corpus, our automatically trained model gave a performance of 86.6percent (F1, sentences le 40 words), which is comparable to that of an unlexicalized PCFG parser created using extensive manual feature selection.},
