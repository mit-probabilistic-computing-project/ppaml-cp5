This demo shows how to evaluate a grammar using the Berkeley Parser and EVALB.

You need to download wsj_test.22.txt and wsj_gold.22.txt.
If you don't have a learned grammar in text format (.grammar, .lexicon, .states), you'll also need to download a grammar object output by the Berkeley Parser.
EVALB can be downloaded here: http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/.
You may need to compile it after downloading.

You may need to change the path in the Makefile.

### Instructions ###

- `make test`: 
   (Optional: generate .grammar, .lexicon, .states from a Berkeley grammar object.)
   Dump a grammar object by reading .grammar, .lexicon and .states files.
   Run Berkeley parser on the dev set.
   Evaluate the result by EVALB.
